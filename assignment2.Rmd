# Overview:
#### Learning Goals
After attending lecture/labs and completing this problem set you should be able to do the following: 

* write a complete R program with conditionals and iterations, functions, including plotting but no reading/writing of files, etc. which will be covered later
* understand relationship between R, R studio, package installation, package/library include in code, R console output, R script and R markdown script
* understand and apply algorithmic thinking to write pseudo-code
* know how to use the help functions and find commands etc.
* initialize a git repo, add files, remove files, commit, push, pull, and tag


#### Instructions:
You are to complete and turn in this problem set by **Thursday September 20 at 9:44 am**. The final problem will show you how to turn in your problem set.

All code should be included in the submission, and should be saved in an _r markdown_ file. Any answers should be included as comments immediately below the code responsible, and should be labelled as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# CODE 2a
Put your code here
and if you need another line, put it here,
and also here!
```

When plotting *remember to appropriately label your axes*

## Exercise 1 (18 points)

Data Exploration with the mtcars dataset.
The built-in dataset, ```mtcars``` includes data from the _Motor Trend_ magazine for 1973-74 models of thirty-two automobiles on eleven different variables.

```{r}
head(mtcars)
fuel<-mtcars$mpg
scaled.fuel <- scale(fuel)
hist(fuel)

```


### 1.1 (8 pts)

(5 pts) Create a basic historgram with x- and y-labels to show the distribution of fuel efficiency (mpg) in the data set.  Normalize the mpg data so that the frequency falls on a scale from 0 to 1.

(3 pts) Which range of mpg is the most frequent?  The least frequent?

```{r}
# Create Histogram

# ANSWER 1.1
# Fuel range between 15 to 20 has the highest frequency
```

### 1.2 (3 pts) 

Create a new data.frame, *cars_new*, that has two new columns, *make* and *pow*, where *make* stores the make of the car and *pow* stores the power-to-weight ratio (i.e. hp to weight) for each car

*Note* The dataset stores the make of the car as the data frame's row names
    
```{r}
# Create the new data.frame with new fields
cars_new["make"]<-NA
cars_new["pow"]<- (cars_new$hp/cars_new$wt)

```

### 1.3 (7 pts)

(2 pts) Sort the dataframe by horsepower-to-weight ratio from lowest to highest.

(5 pts) Create a bar plot showing the make of each car vs. the power-to-weight ratio for each car using the ordered data.

*Hint* look into the barplot arguement "las" and "cex.names" to make the x-axis more legible

```{r}
# Sort by power to weight
cars_new <- mtcars
cars_new["make"]<-NA
cars_new["pow"]<- (cars_new$hp/cars_new$wt)
sorted <- cars_new[order(cars_new$pow),]
sorted
# Create bar plot

counts <- table(cars_new$pow)
barplot(counts, main="Cars_new",xlab="pow", cex.names = 0.5) 
```


## Exercise 2 (22 pts)

### 2.1 (11 pts)

Using the function **quantile()**, consider the dataset **iris** and create a new field that color codes the elements of the dataframe as:

* 'blue': small elements showing both petal length and width below their first quartiles (i.e. quantile 0.25 calculated for each) 
* 'red': large elements showing both petal length and width above their third quartiles (i.e. quantile 0.75 calculated for each)
* 'grey': normal elments showing either petal length or width between their first and third quartiles

Write pseudo code to display a scatterplot comparing the petal lengths and widths.  Show the steps necessary to color the petals based on the classification described above

```{txt}
--- WRITE PSEUDO CODE HERE ---
  
create new data field using quantile in dataset iris
if(quantile.value == 0.25)
  set colorcode= blue
else if (quantile.value==0.75)
  set colorcode=red
else
  set colorcode=grey

```

### 2.2 (11 pts)

Create a scatterplot comparing the petal lengths and widths.  Show the steps necessary to color the three categories of petals as follows:

- blue for 'small' elements
- red for 'large' elements
- grey for 'normal' elements

In your actual code, use filled points (i.e. pch=19), e.g. ```plot(arg, arg, ..., pch = 19)```. Add proper title, axes labels and legend at the bottom-right corner of the figure for the three classes.  

Using ```?plot``` will tell you how to add a plot title and axis labels.  You can add the legend using the function, ```legend``` as follows: ```legend("bottomright",[vector of data labels], [vector of color codes], pch=19)```

```{r}
# Create column for small/normal/large colors

# Create scatterplot

# add legend

data<-iris
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, col=c('red','blue','grey'),xlab = "Petal Length",ylab="Petal Width")
legend(7,4.3,unique(data$Species),col=1:length('blue'),pch=1)


```


## Exercise 3 (54 pts)

The iris dataset has a set of 4 numeric columns. Create a simple scatter plot for every possible pair of numeric columns in the dataset (6 plots in total) using a for loop. Do not plot pairs composed by the same variable on X and Y and plot X VS Y only once (do not plot Y VS X). 

Display the plot as a 2X3 panel and name the axes appropriately for every pair. Add a non-linear trend line with line width 2 (see ?lowess). The main title of each plot should report the p-value of the pearson correlation test. If the test result is not significant at alpha 0.05, draw the trend line in blue, otherwise red.

Hint 1: The functions ```colnames```, ```setdiff()```, ```combn```maybe helpful in answering this question.
Hint 2: The function, ```lowess``` can be used to perform the fitting.
Hint 3: The function, ```cor.test()$[desired component]``` can be used to perform and extract results of a correlation test.
Hint 4: Use the function, ```par(mfrow=[vector of  rows and columns of figure])``` to create a figure with subplots.

  a. (6 pts) Write a list of instructions to solve this problem step-by-step in English for the first column pair, **Sepal Length and Sepal Width**.

```{txt}
<!-- List of instructions for single pair -->
1. make a local numeric variable to store the increasing index i.
2. Get all variable names in an array from iris data frame
3. Select the first index from iris using i and i+1 for second index to plot first two variables
```
  
  b. (6 pts) Now translate your instructions from part a into pseudocode
  
```{txt}
<!-- Pseudo code for single pair -->
i=0
  for(colnam in iris)
      i=i+1
       if(i<6)
       plot (x=iris[i] y= iris[i+1])


```

  c. (6 pts) Now translate your pseudocode into actual running code
  
```{r}
# Follow instructions for single pair
namescol<-colnames(iris)
i<-0
for(c in namescol){
    i<-i+1
    if(i<6){
      plot(x = iris[i] ,y = iris[i+1],
           xlab = "Petal Length",
           ylab = "Petal Width",
           main = "Length vs Width"
           
      )
    }
  }
  

```

  d. (18 pts) Repeat steps a - c for the first two column pairs, **Sepal Length and Sepal Width** and **Sepal Length and Petal Length**.

```{txt}
<!-- List of instructions for two pairs -->

```

```{txt}
<!-- Pseudo code for two pairs -->

```

```{r}
# Follow instructions for first two pairs

```
  
  e. (18 pts) Now, repeat steps a - c for all six combinations  of numeric columns.

```{r}
# Get all combinations

# Set up subplot

# Plot every combination
namescol<-colnames(iris)
i<-0
for(name in namescol )
{
  for(c in namescol){
    i<-i+1
    if(i<6){
      plot(x = iris[i] ,y = iris[i+1],
           xlab = "Petal Length",
           ylab = "Petal Width",
           main = "Length vs Width"
           
      )
    }
  }
  
}
```


## Question 4 (10 pts)

### Version control with Git

This question will take you through the process of sharing results via Git.  Much of it can be done with GitHub desktop, but parts will require a little bit of work in the command line.

Note: if you are already familiar with git, you may use the command line to do the same functionality. Also, Github Desktop only works on Mac or Windows; if your computer uses a different OS, you will need to use the command line and take a screen shot

*To provide screenshots use the following function in the code blocks below but remove eval = F*

```{r, out.width = "400px", eval = F}
# Screenshot of cloned repo

`knitr::include_graphics("mypic.png")`
```
